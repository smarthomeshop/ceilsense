# CeilSense firmware â€“ GitHub Pages branch (gh-pages)

This branch hosts the public firmware artifacts and manifests for CeilSense. It is served via GitHub Pages and is intended to be consumed by:
- ESP Web Tools (browser-based flashing)
- OTA update integrations (using the JSON manifest)

## Do not edit manually
Files in this branch are generated by the CI workflow in the default branch. Any manual changes will be overwritten on the next publish.

## Layout
Depending on the workflow configuration, you will find:
- Per-variant folders (recommended)
  - `ceilsense-v1/<variant>/` containing:
    - `merged-firmware.bin` (single image for ESP Web Tools)
    - `firmware.factory.bin`, `firmware.ota.bin`, `*.elf` (if exported by the builder)
    - `manifest.json` (variant-specific)
- Aggregate manifests at the root (optional), e.g.:
  - `ceilsense-basic-wifi-manifest.json`
  - These reference the paths inside the per-variant folder so external tools have a stable URL.

## OTA update manifest
The CeilSense ESPHome consume the per-variant `manifest.json` directly. 

## How this branch is updated
- On pushes to the default branch (or when manually dispatched), the CI pipeline:
  1) builds all variants with ESPHome
  2) exports firmware and per-variant manifests
  3) writes an optional aggregate manifest
  4) deploys this folder structure to the `gh-pages` branch
